Submitted my latest paper: "Camera-view Supervision for Bird's-Eye-View Semantic Segmentation" to Frontiers in Big Data! 
I worked really hard on this. Hopefully it gets accepted. 
I think the reviews will come out during RSI. Hopefully I have time to do my rebuttal!

Thanks to my co-authors (LinLin Yu and Professor Chen) for the guidance and computing resources!
